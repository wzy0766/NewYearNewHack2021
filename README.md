## Overview of New Year New Hack 2021
In this project, I worked on a hospital web building intertwined with back-end database management based on phpMyAdmin software and Google Cloud SQL server to connect remote patients with the nearest hospital during an emergency, which contains four major features:
* Registeration & Log-in form.
* A notification  system on the hospital-side.
* Alert on the patient-side.
* Location tracker for patients to find the nearest hospital.
* Data processing system based on Google Cloud Platform.
